    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>
      I am an assistant professor at the Department of Physics and the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering & Sciences, of the University of Texas at Austin. My background is in theoretical and computational condensed matter physics. I received my Ph.D. at the University of Cambridge, UK in 2021, and I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National lab between 2021 and 2023. Between 2023 and 2025 I was a research scientist at the NASA Ames Research Center.

      I am interested in understanding the complex physics that arises in the microscopic scales of materials, where the principles of quantum mechanics dominate. My theoretical work goes hand in hand with using computing technologies, including quantum computing and classical high-performance computing on powerful supercomputers.
