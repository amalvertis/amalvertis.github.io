    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>
      I am a research scientist currently working at the NASA Ames Research Center, in California, USA. My background is in theoretical and computational condensed matter physics. I received my Ph.D. at the University of Cambridge, UK in 2021, and I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National lab between 2021 and 2023.

      I am interested in understanding the complex physics that arises in the microscopic scales of materials, where the principles of quantum mechanics dominate. My theoretical work goes hand in hand with using computing technologies, including quantum computing and classical high-performance computing on powerful supercomputers.

      I also really enjoy running and reading literature, with some of my favorite authors being John Steinbeck, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Jack London.
