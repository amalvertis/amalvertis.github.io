    When I am not thinking about Physics, I try to spend time in nature, particularly along the pacific coastline, which is close to where I live. I love reading, with some of my favorite authors including Nikos Kazantzakis, John Steinbeck, Plato, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Jack London and Leo Tolstoy.

    I also enjoy cooking for my wife, having long chats with friends over coffee, and going for runs.
