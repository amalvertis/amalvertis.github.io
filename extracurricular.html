    When I am not thinking about Physics, I enjoy spending time in nature, as I have been lucky enough to live close to the Pacific coastline and have access to some of the most breathtaking places on earth - comparable to those of my mother country. I am an avid reader, with a particular focus on 19th and early 20th century literature, ancient and modern Greek literature. Some of my favorite authors include Nikos Kazantzakis, John Steinbeck, Plato, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Jack London, and Leo Tolstoy.

    I also enjoy cooking for my wife, having long chats with friends over coffee, and going for runs.
