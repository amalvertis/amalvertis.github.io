  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I grew up in Athens, Greece, where I graduated from the Physics department of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens in 2014, having received an Antonios Papadakis scholarship to support my undergraduate studies. Between 2014 and 2016, I studied for an M.Sc. degree in Organic and Molecular Electronics at the TU Dresden in Germany, under a scholarship from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).

  In 2016, I moved to the UK to pursue a Ph.D. degree at the University of Cambridge, from where I graduated in 2021, having completed my research at the Cavendish Laboratory. My thesis, entitled ‘On Exciton-Vibration and Exciton-Photon interactions in Organic Semiconductors’, won the Cavendish Ph.D. prize in Computational Physics and the Springer Thesis prize for outstanding Ph.D. research, and was published as a book within the ‘Springer Theses’ series found <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-85454-6" target="_blank">here</a>.

    In 2021, I moved to the USA under a research fellowship from the Winton Programme of the Physics of Sustainability to pursue postdoctoral work at the University of California Berkeley and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. In 2023, I started working as a staff scientist at the NASA Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley, where my research attempts to push the frontiers of our understanding of the physics of materials, by employing a combination of quantum and classical computing. My research was recognized with the 2024 Theoretical Physics award of the Academy of Athens, and I was one of five finalists for the international Volker Heine Early-Career Investigator Award, which recognizes individuals for their outstanding contribution to developing fundamental theory, algorithms, and computer codes in order to understand, predict, and design materials properties and functions. In January of 2026 I will be joining the Department of Physics of the University of Texas at Austin as an assistant professor.
