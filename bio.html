  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I grew up in Athens, Greece, where I graduated from the Physics department of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens in 2014, having received an Antonios Papadakis scholarship to support my undergraduate studies. Between 2014 and 2016, I studied for an M.Sc. degree in Organic and Molecular Electronics at the TU Dresden in Germany, under a scholarship from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).

  In 2016, I moved to the UK to pursue a Ph.D. degree at the University of Cambridge, from where I graduated in 2021, having completed my research at the Cavendish Laboratory. My thesis, entitled ‘On Exciton-Vibration and Exciton-Photon interactions in Organic Semiconductors’, won the Cavendish Ph.D. prize in Computational Physics and the Springer Thesis prize for outstanding Ph.D. research, and was published as a book within the ‘Springer Theses’ series found <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-85454-6" target="_blank">here</a>.

    In 2021, I moved to the USA under a research fellowship from the Winton Programme of the Physics of Sustainability to pursue postdoctoral work at the University of California Berkeley and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. In 2023, I started working as a staff scientist at the NASA Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley, where my research attempts to push the frontiers of our understanding of the physics of materials, by employing a combination of quantum and classical computing. In January of 2026 I will be joining the Department of Physics of the University of Texas at Austin as an assistant professor.
